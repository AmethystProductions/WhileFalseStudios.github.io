Hello, World! The WFS site now has a blog. Currently there is nothing here, but expect more to come in the next few months.

This blog will contain the usual gamedev stuff: research, interesting solutions to problems we encounter, announcements etc. *Maybe* I will be able to convince the others to write up things they do as well.

We are currently in the process of setting up a proper social media network. I just recently set up a Twitter account (@wfs_gamedev) and Youtube channel; neither have anything there yet. Twitter also apparently thinks I am a robot, has locked the account and wants my phone number, which is convenient. Oh, the joys of marketing...
