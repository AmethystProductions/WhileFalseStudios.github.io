We participate in game jams when silly things like "real-life responsibilties" aren't getting in the way. Here's a journal of all our days of incredibly unhealthy sleep patterns.

## Ludum Dare 37 - December 2016
Participants: Andrew, David

We successfully finished the Ludum Dare 37 Jam (theme: One Room), creating a first-person platformer with a time travel mechanic similar to Titanfall 2.
