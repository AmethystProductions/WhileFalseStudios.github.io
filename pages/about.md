Andrew Castillo is a tools/pipeline programmer at While False Studios and a student when exams close in. He enjoys games no one else seems to like, studying the structures and tools used by other game engines, and making terrible, cringeworthy references to anything he can think of. Online, he goes by the name Valax321.
